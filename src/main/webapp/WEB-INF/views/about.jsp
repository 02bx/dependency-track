<p>
    Dependency-Track is a web application that allows organizations to document the use of third-party components
    across multiple applications and versions.
</p>

<p>
    The <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013">OWASP Top Ten 2013</a> introduces, for the first time,
    the use of third-party components with known vulnerabilities. Dependency-Track aims to document the usage of all
    components, the vendors, libraires, versions and licenses used and provide visibility into the use of vulnerable
    components.
