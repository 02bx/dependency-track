Dependency-Track
=========

Modern applications leverage the availability of existing components for use as building blocks 
in application development. By using existing components, organizations can dramatically decrease
time-to-market. Reusing existing components however, comes at a cost. Organizations that build on 
top of existing components assume risk for software they did not create. Vulnerabilities in third-party
components are inherited by all applications that use those components. The [OWASP Top Ten] (2013 and 2017)
both recognize the risk of [using components with known vulnerabilities](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A9-Using_Components_with_Known_Vulnerabilities).

Dependency-Track is a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) platform that keeps track of all third-party 
components used in all the applications an organization creates or consumes. It integrates with multiple
vulnerability databases including the [National Vulnerability Database] (NVD), [Node Security Platform] (NSP),
and [VulnDB] from [Risk Based Security]. Dependency-Track monitors all applications in its portfolio in order
to proactively identify vulnerabilities in components that are placing your applications at risk. Use of 
Dependency-Track can play a vital role in an overall [Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Supply-Chain-Risk-Management) (C-SCRM) 
program by fulfilling many of the recommendations laid out by [SAFECode](https://www.safecode.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SAFECode_TPC_Whitepaper.pdf).

Dependency-Track is designed to be used in an automated DevOps environment where [Dependency-Check]
results or specific BOM (Bill of Material) formats are automatically ingested during CI/CD. Use of the 
[Dependency-Check Jenkins Plugin] is highly recommended for this purpose and is well suited for use
in [Jenkins Pipeline]. In such an environment, Dependency-Track enables your DevOps teams to accelerate while
still keeping tabs on component usage and any inherited risk.

Dependency-Track can also be used to monitor vulnerabilities in COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) software.

**NOTICE: Always use official binary releases in production.**

Distributions
-------------------

Dependency-Track supports the following three deployment options:

* Docker container (continuous snapshots available now)
* Executable WAR (will be available with 3.0.0)
* Conventional WAR (will be available with 3.0.0)

Deploying Docker Container
-------------------

Deploying with Docker is the easiest and fastest method of getting started. No prerequisites are required
other than an modern version of Docker. Dependency-Track uses the following conventions:


* The 'latest' tag, which is pulled by default if no tag is specified, will always refer to the latest stable release (3.0.0, 3.0.1, 3.1.0, etc)
* The 'snapshot' tag will be built and pushed on all CI changes to the master. Use this if you want a "moving target" with all the latest changes.
* Version tags (3.0.0, 3.0.1, etc) are used to indicate each release


```shell
docker pull owasp/dependency-track
docker volume create --name dependency-track
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name dependency-track -v dependency-track:/data owasp/dependency-track
```

To run snapshot releases (not recommended for production):

```shell
docker pull owasp/dependency-track:snapshot
docker volume create --name dependency-track
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name dependency-track -v dependency-track:/data owasp/dependency-track:snapshot
```

Deploying the Executable WAR
-------------------

Another simple way to get Dependency-Track running quickly is to automatically deploy the executable WAR. This
method requires Java 8u101 or higher. Simply download `dependency-track-embedded.war` and execute:

```shell
java -Xmx4G -jar dependency-track-embedded.war
```

Deploying the Conventional WAR
-------------------

This is the most difficult to deploy option as it requires an already installed and configured Servlet 
container such as Apache Tomcat 8.5 and higher, however, it offers the most flexible deployment options.
Follow the Servlet containers instructions for deploying `dependency-track.war`.
 
 
Compiling From Sources (optional)
-------------------

To create an executable WAR that is ready to launch (recommended for most users):

```shell
mvn clean package -P embedded-jetty
```

To create a WAR that must be manually deployed to a modern Servlet container (i.e. Tomcat 8.5+):

```shell
mvn clean package
```

To create an executable WAR that is ready to be deployed in a Docker container:

```shell
mvn clean package -P embedded-jetty -Dlogback.configuration.file=src/main/docker/logback.xml
```

Support
-------------------

Dependency-Track is an open source project, created by people who believe that the knowledge of using 
vulnerable components should be accessible to anyone with a desire to know. By supporting this project, you'll
allow the team to outsource testing, infrastructure, further research and development efforts, and engage in 
outreach to various communities that would benefit from this technology.
