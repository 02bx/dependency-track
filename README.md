Dependency-Track
=========

This is the development branch of v3.0, the next generation of Dependency-Track, 
written from the ground-up, using an API-first design, modern technologies, and
without many of the limitations of the previous versions. Version 3 is not 
backward compatible with previous versions due to fundamentally different approaches
and data models.

Introduction
-
OWASP Dependency-Track is a Java web application that allows organizations to
document the use of third-party components across multiple applications and
versions. Further, it provides automatic visibility into the use of components
with known vulnerabilities.

The OWASP Top Ten 2013 introduces, for the first time, the use of third-party
components with known vulnerabilities. Dependency-Track aims to document the
usage of all components, the vendors, libraires, versions and licenses used
and provide visibility into the use of vulnerable components.

Dependency-Track is built on top of [Alpine].
