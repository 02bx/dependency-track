Dependency-Track
=========

Dependency-Track is a web application that allows organizations to document the use of third-party components across multiple applications and versions.

The OWASP Top Ten 2013 introduces, for the first time, the use of third-party components with known vulnerabilities. Dependency-Track aims to document the usage of all components, the vendors, libraires, versions and licenses used and provide visibility into the use of vulnerable components.

Development of Dependency-Track is sponsored by [Axway]

More information can be found on the [wiki].
