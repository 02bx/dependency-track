The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) is the largest publicly available source of vulnerability intelligence.
It is maintained by a group within the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and builds upon the
work of MITRE and others. Vulnerabilities in the NVD are called Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE). There
are over 100,000 CVEs documented in the NVD spanning from the 1990's to the present.

Dependency-Track relies heavily on the data provided by the NVD. Dependency-Track mirrors the entire contents
of the NVD. The mirror is kept up-to-date on a daily basis, or upon the restarting of the Dependency-Track instance.

Credit is provided to the National Vulnerability Database with visual and textual cues on where the data originated.
Links back to the original CVE are also provided.
