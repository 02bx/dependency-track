**Features:**

* Improvements to Findings API

**Fixes:**

* Corrected issue that incorrectly returned suppressed vulnerabilities when queried for non-suppressed ones

**Upgrade Notes:**

The Findings API, used by the audit tab in the UI, has been modified. The JSON payload from this API is altered in a
way that makes it incompatible with previous versions. If this API is used for various external integration, please
make note of this change.
